"The GIAC Advisory Board is made up of GIAC certified professionals who want to take a more active role in the GIAC community. The Advisory Board provides a forum where information security professionals can exchange ideas and advice, and discuss issues directly related to GIAC and SANS business, such as training and certification.

Occasionally, the Advisory Board also features opportunities for paid work, such as SANS courseware development or GIAC exam question development. Participation is by invitation only."
